# Python_Person
Python framework to create person, group, and unittest classes, with an sql database.

This project started as an interview programming challenge.

Since then it has evolved into the framework for a Person-class text file to database converter with unit testing, using sqlite3. 

The current python version has:
    
    0.   A ThisPerson class which defines the methods and attributes of the fundamental ThisPerson object
    1.   A ThisGroup class which creates an expandable, iterable and testable array of ThisPerson text objects
    2.   A text file to sql interface for creation and manipulation of a database of ThisPerson text objects
    3.   A unittest framework with assertions, searchlists, and iterators for testing all classes
    
This project is under continuous development, and may change at any time.
